**Chapter I: Stranded at Sea**
---

Journey begins, you're a passenger.

… Retrospect

Dead or dying body in a survival suit afloat on the waves. Dragged in, the body disappears after some time. There appears to be a beacon of blue light bobbing in the swirling darkness of the waves that churned just off the side of the boat. I focused in on the scene for a few moments and could make out the glimmer of bright orange cutting through the fog. It was an unmistakable sight for someone who worked on a fishing boat – a survival suit bobbing like a fishing lure on the water.

…

Fade in. We suddenly find ourselves in the middle of the sea in a small vessel. Waves hum dark songs. Smyczek gra. Darkness outside, small light inside. We're in a cabin, lighting a candle not to drain the battery.

"If it wasn't for the curiosity that has always driven me through life I wouldn't have ended here. I didn't know what would become of me once I began the travel."

**Chapter II: The Wallows Deadly**
---

Journey Taken Over (you're the captain).

The Wallows Deadly shallow waters in deep sea. Player can go out of the ship and investigate.

**Chapter III: **
---

You're tasked with the delivery of a certain thing to a certain place at sea (the wallows)
