Seafarer Wallows
weird fiction adventure game

**Watch, watch, watch the sea...**

A chapter-based Nautical Weird Fiction Adventure with management elements, inspired by Lovecraftian myths and the endless narrative possibilities and exploration of Fallen London and Sunless Sea.

**Welcome to a weird world.**

For our main protagonist it must be a puzzling experience at best but it doesn't have to be for you. Here are some of the things you shall experience in Seafarer Wallows:

- Be a captain of a floating private investigation bureau. Collect a variety of bizarre and outrageous inhabitants along the way.
- Explore a world filled with unique locations, discover the mystery and the lore behind them, meet intriguing characters.
- Your time is precious so you decide how to play. Take the story in slowly or all-at-once. Each chapter is designed to be accomplished in 15 minutes or more. 

**Experience the features.**

3+ Playable Adventures with 3 chapters each and more to come!
Narrative Choices based on influence node system.
Multiple Endings based on your in-game choices and relationships.
Unique Dynamic Soundtrack made by a very special person.
Fully Voiced with an active narrator and subtitle options.
